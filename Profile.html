This test put me into the category of “Campainer ENFP-A”.
In summary it estimates that I am an extraverted, assertive and I direct my mental energy toward curiosity and imagination. It says I approach my work with flexibility and am good at improvising and easily spot oppurtunities.
These results seem to be true to my personal understanding of myself but that is where any self diagnosed test ends. They are limited in validity by the “correctness” of our own understanding of ones self relative to others and relative to the way the test is created. It is also hard to be truly honest and not to answer in ways that you assume the test wants us to or in ways that align with social norms.
These results will not influence my behaviour in a team nor would I take this into account when forming a team as the simple knowledge of these results, proven or not, would not be enough to change they way I approach work, life or learning.

This test says that my primary learning style is “Activist” and my secondary learning style is “Pragmatist”.
This result I strongly dissagree with as it states that my primary learning style enjoys learning by brainstorming, group discussions and role playing, all of which I do not enjoy.
These results will not influence my behaviour in a team nor would I take this into account when forming a team as the simple knowledge of these results, proven or not, would not be enough to change they way I approach work, life or learning.

Big 5 Personality Results: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcjoonQ8gHRLVYgo7htAjiac3rEU7nkl/view?usp=sharing" style="color:red;">PDF Link</a>

This test put my in a high percentile for “Extroversion” and “Conscientiousness”. This means that I am outgoing, social, careful abd diligent. Half of this I believe to be accurate to my personal opinion.
These results will not influence my behaviour in a team nor would I take this into account when forming a team as the simple knowledge of these results, proven or not, would not be enough to change they way I approach work, life or learning.
